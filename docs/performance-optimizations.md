# Performance Optimizations Summary

## Issue #24 Performance Fixes

This document summarizes the performance optimizations implemented to address the performance issues identified in issue #24.

## 1. Toast System Memory Leaks Fixed

### Problem
- Timer memory leaks due to improper cleanup
- Accumulating setTimeout references without clearTimeout
- Missing cleanup on component unmount

### Solution
- **Timer Tracking**: Implemented `useRef<Map<string, NodeJS.Timeout>>` to track all active timers
- **Proper Cleanup**: Each toast removal now clears its associated timer
- **Unmount Cleanup**: Added useEffect cleanup to clear all timers when ToastProvider unmounts
- **Individual Cleanup**: Each ToastItem properly cleans up its animation and exit timers

### Code Changes
- `/apps/web/src/components/ui/Toast.tsx`: Added timer tracking and cleanup
- Used `useCallback` and `useMemo` for performance optimization
- Proper timer management in both auto-removal and manual removal scenarios

## 2. Board Component Re-render Optimization

### Problem
- Excessive re-renders due to non-memoized expensive operations
- Story and column lookups performed on every render
- Inefficient state updates

### Solution
- **Memoized Lookups**: Created `storyLookup` and `columnByStoryLookup` Maps using `useMemo`
- **Optimized Functions**: Used `useCallback` for all event handlers and API functions
- **Efficient Data Processing**: Optimized story grouping with single iteration using `reduce`
- **Batched State Updates**: Combined multiple state updates into single operations

### Code Changes
- `/apps/web/src/components/board/Board.tsx`: Comprehensive optimization
- Story lookup changed from O(n) to O(1) with Map-based lookups
- Memoized expensive computations and callbacks
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders with proper dependency arrays

## 3. Modal Portal Performance

### Problem
- Repeated DOM queries for modal root element
- No caching of portal references
- Performance overhead on every modal render

### Solution
- **Singleton Pattern**: Implemented `ModalRootManager` for centralized portal management
- **Cached References**: Modal root element cached and reused across all modals
- **Test Environment Handling**: Proper fallback for test environments

### Code Changes
- `/apps/web/src/components/modals/ModalPortal.tsx`: New optimized portal component
- Updated `StoryEditModal.tsx` and `DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx` to use optimized portal
- Eliminated repeated `document.getElementById` calls

## Performance Metrics

### Target: Error Handling < 50ms
- Toast creation and display optimized for sub-50ms response time
- Memoized functions prevent unnecessary recalculations
- Efficient timer management reduces overhead

### Memory Usage
- Eliminated timer memory leaks in toast system
- Proper cleanup on component unmount
- Reduced function recreation with memoization

### Render Performance
- Board component lookup operations: O(n) â†’ O(1)
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders through proper memoization
- Cached modal portal references

## Testing
- Added comprehensive performance tests in `/apps/web/src/__tests__/performance/`
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Memory leak prevention validated
- Timer cleanup verified

## Benefits
1. **No Memory Leaks**: Proper timer cleanup prevents memory accumulation
2. **Faster UI Response**: Sub-50ms error handling and modal operations
3. **Better Performance**: Optimized lookups and reduced re-renders
4. **Maintainable Code**: Clean separation of concerns and proper patterns

## Implementation Notes
- All optimizations maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA roles on toast components
- Test coverage maintained and enhanced
