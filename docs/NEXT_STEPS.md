## ðŸš€ How to View Your Issues

### In Browser
Visit: https://github.com/stefanmch/scrumboard/issues

### Using GitHub CLI

```bash
# View all issues
gh issue list

# View epic issues only
gh issue list --label epic

# View critical issues (P0)
gh issue list --label p0-critical

# View issues by milestone
gh issue list --milestone "Phase 1: MVP Foundation"

# View specific epic with details
gh issue view 44  # Epic 1
```

## ðŸ“‹ Recommended: Create a GitHub Project Board

GitHub doesn't have native "Epic" support, so I recommend creating a Project Board for better visualization:

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to https://github.com/stefanmch/scrumboard
2. Click "Projects" tab
3. Click "New project"
4. Choose "Board" view
5. Name it "ScrumBoard Development"
6. Add columns: "Backlog", "In Progress", "In Review", "Done"
7. Add your epic issues to the board

### Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (Beta)
```bash
# Create a project (requires beta features)
gh project create --owner stefanmch --title "ScrumBoard Development"

# Then add issues via the web interface
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Suggested Starting Point

### Week 1: Authentication Foundation

**Start with these issues (in order):**

1. **Issue #56**: Implement Authentication API Endpoints
   - This is the foundation for everything else
   - Start here to get the backend working
   ```bash
   gh issue view 56
   ```

2. **Issue #54**: Create Login/Register UI Pages
   - Build the UI once API is ready
   - This gives you a working auth system
   ```bash
   gh issue view 54
   ```

3. **Issue #57**: Implement User Profile API Endpoints
   ```bash
   gh issue view 57
   ```

4. **Issue #55**: Build User Profile Management UI
   ```bash
   gh issue view 55
   ```

### How to Start Working on an Issue

```bash
# 1. Assign yourself to the issue
gh issue edit 56 --add-assignee @me

# 2. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/issue-56-auth-api

# 3. Start coding!

# 4. Commit with issue reference
git commit -m "feat: add login endpoint

Implements user login with JWT authentication
Part of #56"

# 5. Create PR when ready
git push -u origin feature/issue-56-auth-api
gh pr create --fill

# 6. In PR description, add: "Closes #56"
```

## ðŸ“š Documentation Created

I've created two important documents:

1. **`docs/github-issues-plan.md`**
   - Detailed analysis of current vs missing features
   - Complete breakdown of all 10 epics
   - Specific tasks for each epic
   - Priority matrix and timeline

2. **`docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_SUMMARY.md`**
   - Summary of all created issues
   - Status of implementation
   - Quick reference guide
   - Progress tracking commands

## ðŸ”„ Creating Additional Issues

You'll want to create more detailed issues for Epics 4-10. Use the pattern from the issues I created:

**Template for new issues:**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Feature: Your Feature Name" \
  --milestone "Phase X: Name" \
  --label "feature,priority-label,api|ui" \
  --body "## Epic
Part of #XX (Epic Name)

## Description
What needs to be done

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Technical Details
Location: \`path/to/files\`

## Acceptance Criteria
- Criteria 1
- Criteria 2

## Estimated Effort
X-Y days"
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Understanding Epic Organization

Since GitHub doesn't have built-in "Epic" support, here's how the organization works:

**Epics (Issues #44-53)**
- High-level grouping of related features
- Labeled with `epic`
- Listed in milestone
- Contains checklist of sub-issues in description

**Feature Issues (Issues #54-61+)**
- Detailed implementation tasks
- Reference parent epic in description
- Labeled with `feature`
- Assigned to same milestone as epic

**Linking:**
- Feature issues reference epic: "Part of #44"
- Epic description has checklist of features
- Use milestones to group related work

## ðŸ“Š Tracking Progress

### Daily
```bash
# Check what you're working on
gh issue list --assignee @me --state open

# Update issue status with comments
gh issue comment 56 --body "Completed login endpoint, working on registration next"
```

### Weekly
```bash
# Check milestone progress
gh issue list --milestone "Phase 1: MVP Foundation"

# Check what's completed
gh issue list --milestone "Phase 1: MVP Foundation" --state closed
```

### Sprint Planning
Use the epic issues (#44-53) for sprint planning. Each epic is sized at 2-3 weeks, so you might take one epic per sprint or split larger epics into multiple sprints.

## ðŸ¤” Common Questions

**Q: Why are there only 10 epic issues?**
A: I grouped all features into 10 major themes. Each epic contains multiple features that will need their own issues.

**Q: Should I create all sub-issues now?**
A: No, create them as you need them. I created the critical ones (#54-61) to get you started.

**Q: How do I know what to work on first?**
A: Follow the P0 (critical) issues in Phase 1 milestone. Start with Epic 1 (Authentication).

**Q: Can I change the milestones/priorities?**
A: Absolutely! These are recommendations. Adjust based on your needs.

**Q: How do I group issues visually?**
A: Use GitHub Projects (board view) or filter by labels/milestones.

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

Track these to measure progress:

- **Epics Completed**: X/10
- **Phase 1 Issues Closed**: X/Y
- **Test Coverage**: Target 80%+
- **Sprint Velocity**: Track over time

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

If you need to create more detailed issues or adjust the structure:

1. Review the existing issues for patterns
2. Use the templates in `docs/github-issues-plan.md`
3. Keep issues focused on one feature
4. Link related issues together
5. Use milestones to group by delivery phase

## ðŸŽŠ You're All Set!

You now have:
- âœ… 10 Epics covering all features
- âœ… 8 Detailed issues to start with
- âœ… 4 Milestones for phased delivery
- âœ… Proper labels and organization
- âœ… Clear documentation
- âœ… Recommended starting point

**Next Action:**
```bash
gh issue view 56
git checkout -b feature/issue-56-auth-api
# Start coding!
```

Good luck with your ScrumBoard development! ðŸš€
