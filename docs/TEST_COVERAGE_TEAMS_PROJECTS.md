## Test Patterns Used

### API Client Tests
- Mock `fetch` globally for consistent API mocking
- Mock `localStorage` for authentication token handling
- Use `mockResolvedValue` for successful responses
- Use `mockRejectedValue` for error scenarios
- Test both success and error paths
- Validate request headers and body

### Component Tests
- Use React Testing Library for component rendering
- Test user interactions with `fireEvent`
- Validate DOM structure and content
- Test callback prop invocations
- Test conditional rendering
- Test loading and disabled states

## Code Quality Metrics

- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of all major user flows
- **Edge Cases**: Network errors, validation failures, permission checks
- **Accessibility**: Tests verify proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
- **User Experience**: Loading states, error messages, empty states tested
- **Security**: Permission-based access control tested

## Next Steps

### Recommended Additional Tests
1. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end user flows across multiple components
2. **Page Tests**: Complete page-level testing with router navigation
3. **Form Tests**: TeamFormModal and ProjectFormModal component tests
4. **Hook Tests**: Custom hooks for team/project management
5. **Visual Regression**: Screenshot tests for UI consistency

### Test Maintenance
- Keep tests updated with API changes
- Add tests for new features
- Refactor tests to reduce duplication
- Improve test naming for clarity

## Conclusion

The Team & Project Management UI now has **comprehensive test coverage** with 83 passing tests covering:
- All API client operations
- All component rendering scenarios
- Error handling and edge cases
- Loading states and user interactions
- Permission-based access control

This test suite provides confidence in the reliability and correctness of the team and project management features.
