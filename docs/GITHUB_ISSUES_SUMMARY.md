## üìù Notes

- **GitHub doesn't have native "Epic" functionality**, so we're using regular issues with the `epic` label and tracking sub-issues in the description
- You can create a GitHub Project Board to visualize the epics and their progress
- Consider using task lists in epic descriptions to track sub-issues
- The milestones provide a timeline for delivery
- Detailed issues for Epics 4-10 still need to be created (approximately 40-50 more issues)

---

## ü§ù Contributing

When working on issues:

1. **Assign yourself** to the issue
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/issue-XX-description`
3. **Link commits** to issues: Use `#XX` in commit messages
4. **Create PR** when ready for review
5. **Link PR to issue**: Use "Closes #XX" in PR description
6. **Request review** from team members

---

## üé® Using GitHub Projects (Recommended)

Consider creating a GitHub Project Board to organize these epics:

```bash
# Create a project board
gh project create "ScrumBoard Development" --owner stefanmch

# Add epic issues to the board
# (Can be done via GitHub UI)
```

**Suggested Columns:**
- üìã Backlog
- üèóÔ∏è In Progress
- üëÄ In Review
- ‚úÖ Done
