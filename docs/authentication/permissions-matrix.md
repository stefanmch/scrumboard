## Permission Inheritance Rules

### Role Hierarchy Inheritance
- **SUPER_ADMIN** → Inherits all permissions from all roles
- **ADMIN** → Inherits all permissions within organizational scope
- **SCRUM_MASTER** → Inherits PRODUCT_OWNER + DEVELOPER permissions + team management
- **PRODUCT_OWNER** → Inherits STAKEHOLDER permissions + product management
- **DEVELOPER** → Inherits basic GUEST permissions + development work
- **STAKEHOLDER** → Inherits enhanced GUEST permissions + visibility
- **GUEST** → Base level permissions only

### Scope-Based Permission Resolution
1. **Global Scope**: SUPER_ADMIN permissions apply everywhere
2. **Organization Scope**: ADMIN permissions apply within assigned organizations
3. **Project Scope**: Role permissions apply within assigned projects
4. **Team Scope**: Role permissions apply within assigned teams
5. **Resource Scope**: Permissions apply to specifically assigned resources

### Permission Conflict Resolution
1. **Most Permissive Wins**: If user has multiple roles, highest permission level applies
2. **Scope Specificity**: More specific scope overrides general scope
3. **Explicit Deny**: Explicit deny permissions override inherited allows
4. **Temporal Validity**: Expired permissions are immediately revoked

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign minimum necessary permissions
2. **Regular Audits**: Review permissions quarterly
3. **Role Rotation**: Consider rotating sensitive roles
4. **Documentation**: Document any custom role assignments
5. **Training**: Ensure users understand their permissions

### Common Permission Patterns
1. **New Team Member**: Start with GUEST, promote to DEVELOPER
2. **Experienced Developer**: DEVELOPER role with specific project assignments
3. **Team Lead**: SCRUM_MASTER for their teams
4. **Product Manager**: PRODUCT_OWNER for their products
5. **Department Head**: ADMIN for their organizational unit

This permissions matrix ensures secure, granular access control while maintaining operational flexibility for agile development teams.
