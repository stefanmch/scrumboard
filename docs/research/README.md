### 4. [Sprint Metrics Algorithms](./sprint-metrics-algorithms.md)
**Purpose:** Mathematical algorithms for sprint metrics and calculations.

**Contents:**

**Core Metrics:**
- Story count metrics (total, completed, in-progress, blocked)
- Story point metrics (total, completed, remaining, completion %)
- Velocity calculations (sprint, daily, required, team average)
- Time-based metrics (days total, elapsed, remaining, progress %)
- Sprint health score (composite metric with weighted factors)

**Burndown Chart Algorithms:**
- Ideal burndown line (linear decrease)
- Actual burndown data (daily snapshots)
- Velocity trend line (moving average)
- Combined burndown data generation

**Progress Calculations:**
- Completion percentage (story points & count)
- Time progress percentage
- Sprint forecast (projected velocity, likelihood)

**Advanced Metrics:**
- Story cycle time (average, median, min, max)
- Throughput (stories per day)
- Work in Progress (WIP) limits and utilization

**Priority & Type Breakdowns:**
- Stories by priority (URGENT, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Stories by type (FEATURE, BUG, ENHANCEMENT, SPIKE)

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Service layer structure
- Caching strategy for performance
- Database optimization tips
- Testing approach

## Implementation Checklist

### Backend (NestJS API)

**Database:**
- [x] Sprint model exists in schema.prisma
- [ ] Create SprintComment model indexes
- [ ] Add status change audit trail (optional for advanced metrics)

**Services:**
- [ ] SprintsService (CRUD operations)
- [ ] SprintMetricsService (calculations)
- [ ] SprintAssignmentService (story assignment logic)
- [ ] SprintCommentsService (comment management)

**Controllers:**
- [ ] SprintsController (REST endpoints)
- [ ] Add authentication guards
- [ ] Add Swagger documentation
- [ ] Implement rate limiting

**DTOs:**
- [ ] CreateSprintDto
- [ ] UpdateSprintDto
- [ ] SprintResponseDto
- [ ] SprintMetricsResponseDto
- [ ] CreateSprintCommentDto

**Tests:**
- [ ] Unit tests for services
- [ ] Controller tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] E2E tests

---

### Frontend (Next.js/React)

**Pages:**
- [ ] `/teams/[teamId]/projects/[projectId]/sprints` - Sprint list
- [ ] `/teams/[teamId]/projects/[projectId]/sprints/[sprintId]` - Sprint detail

**Components:**
- [ ] SprintCard
- [ ] SprintBoard

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Nested Resource Routes
**Decision:** Sprints under `/teams/:teamId/projects/:projectId/sprints`

**Rationale:**
- Maintains resource hierarchy
- Consistent with projects API pattern
- Clear ownership and authorization scope

---

### 2. Team-Based Authorization
**Decision:** Verify team membership for all sprint operations

**Rationale:**
- Follows existing projects pattern
- Ensures data privacy and access control
- Team admins for sensitive operations (delete, status changes)

---

### 3. Optimistic UI Updates
**Decision:** Update UI immediately, rollback on error

**Rationale:**
- Follows existing Board component pattern
- Provides immediate user feedback
- Better perceived performance

---

### 4. Sprint Status Lifecycle
**Decision:** PLANNING → ACTIVE → COMPLETED or CANCELLED

**Rationale:**
- Clear sprint phases
- Prevents invalid transitions
- Velocity calculated only on COMPLETED

---

### 5. Story Point vs Story Count Metrics
**Decision:** Primary metric is story points, secondary is story count

**Rationale:**
- Story points reflect work complexity
- Story count useful for sanity checks
- Both metrics provide different insights

---

### 6. Burndown Chart Implementation
**Decision:** Daily snapshots with ideal line overlay

**Rationale:**
- Industry standard visualization
- Easy to interpret sprint health
- Shows both plan and actuals

---

### 7. Real-time Updates
**Decision:** Polling every 30 seconds for active sprints

**Rationale:**
- Simpler than WebSockets for initial implementation
- Sufficient for sprint management use case
- Can upgrade to WebSockets later if needed

---

### 8. Comment Type Categorization
**Decision:** GENERAL, IMPEDIMENT, QUESTION, DECISION, ACTION_ITEM

**Rationale:**
- Enables filtering and organization
- Highlights important discussions (impediments)
- Follows existing StoryComment pattern

---

## Dependencies

### Backend
- **Existing:** NestJS, Prisma, class-validator, @nestjs/swagger
- **No new dependencies required**

### Frontend
- **Existing:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, @dnd-kit
- **New:** recharts (for charts) - already used elsewhere in project
- **No other new dependencies required**

---
