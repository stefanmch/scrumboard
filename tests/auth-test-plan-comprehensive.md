## 🚨 Known Issues & Future Work

### Temporary Changes (Until Email Service)
1. **Email Verification Disabled**
   - Currently: emailVerified set to true on registration
   - TODO: Change to false once email service implemented
   - Location: `apps/api/src/auth/services/auth.service.ts:64`

2. **Login Verification Check Commented**
   - Currently: Email verification check disabled in login
   - TODO: Uncomment lines 162-165 once email service ready
   - Location: `apps/api/src/auth/services/auth.service.ts:162-165`

3. **Registration Message Updated**
   - Currently: "You can now log in with your credentials"
   - TODO: Change to "Please check your email to verify your account"
   - Location: `apps/api/src/auth/services/auth.service.ts:91`

### Future Test Additions
1. Add token refresh flow tests in frontend
2. Add multi-tab synchronization tests
3. Add automatic token refresh on expiry
4. Add email verification flow tests (when service ready)
5. Add OAuth integration tests (if planned)
6. Add 2FA tests (if planned)

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Run full test suite to validate all tests pass
2. Review test coverage report for any gaps
3. Add frontend tests to CI/CD pipeline
4. Document test scenarios in team wiki

### Before Re-enabling Email Verification
1. Implement email service with templates
2. Update all three code locations listed above
3. Update test assertions for email verification
4. Test email delivery in staging environment
5. Update registration message tests

### Long-term Improvements
1. Add E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress
2. Implement visual regression testing
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Set up mutation testing
5. Add accessibility testing with axe-core
